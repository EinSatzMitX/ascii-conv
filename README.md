-m <mode>       Select one of these modes:
   - NORMAL
   - INVERTED
   - BINARY
   - LOW_CONTRAST (This should've been high contrast mode ._.)
   - UNICODE

-f <file name> This is necessary for operation

-s <format>    This allows the user to choose between different formats. If left blank the Ascii-Art will be 50 lines tall with 150 charachters per line.
   - 16:9      
   - 4:3
   - 1:1

-d <true/false>            !MAKE SURE TO SET THIS TO TRUE! Enables discord mode. In discord mode there will be a file generated called "out.txt". This file contains Unicode charchters instead of Ascii charachters, so they won't interfere with discord's special charachters (*, _, ....)

-h             A (not yet) useful list of commands
